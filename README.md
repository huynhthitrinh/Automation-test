Next steps to improve the test:

move all locators used in the test into a separate file(s), according to the Page Object pattern (https://playwright.dev/docs/pom)
redo the authorization step following the core concept introduced by the playwright team (https://playwright.dev/docs/auth)
recommendations:

copied code for typescript should be pasted in the typescript file =)) (.ts)

don't use xpath where css locators can be used + use ui attributes specifically added for e2e tests (data-test-id)

there is no need to make screenshots in the current test, it's enough to add the parameter "screenshot: 'only-on-failure'" in playwright.config.js (so screenshots will be added automatically when test fails)

don't leave console.log() in the code if it's unneccessary

each test logic bloch should be finished with the corresponding assertion(s)

it's better to avoid waits in seconds (.wait(3000))

such conditions:

if (await page.getByText('order overview').isVisible()) console.log("go to Hogashop"); else console.log("don't go to Hogashop!");

don't make sense. It's better to replace it with:

await expect(page.locator('[data-test-id="widget-last-order-time"]')).toBeVisible()
test should fail or pass

it's better to keep README.md in the project with the info how to run tests
